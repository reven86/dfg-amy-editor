- THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT - 

Drag-Drop Items
 - Rather just having Toolbar Click
 - Allow Drag-Start on Toolbar, Drag-Drop in Level View

Resource Library
 - Based on file.xml.xml
 - Keyword Tags are added to all the file elements (Background, Tree, Green etc..)
 - UI allows keyword entry and displays thumbnails of the matching files.
 - Click to load as resource
 - Maybe Drag-Drop as Scenelayer

Make the Goos REALLY look like the Goos
 - Displaying the <body> file is "OK", and allows visual distinction of most types
 - Possibility of just static png, located by Goo type.. if not found, revert to <body> image
 - Really needs a proper "Builder" which pulls in all the graphic elements
 - and Builds the image (on-the-fly) based on the ball.xml
 - Note to self: This would form an excellent basis for the "Ball Editor"

Full Dependancy Checking / Incorporation when making a .goomod
 - Check for any custom balls, particles or materials used in a level
 - Can add all these things to the goomod file automatically
 - And any subsequent dependancies those things might have
