* Releases
  - Makes sure that in src/makedist.bat:
    - SET VERSION=XYZ is the number of the version you want to release.
    - SET SEVENZIPPATH=c:\wut\files\7-Zip\7z.exe points to a valid path to 7-zip
      (can be downloaded from http://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
  - run:
    cd src
    makedist
    Then checks that no error occurred and tarball are available.
    Increases version number in makedist.bat

  - Post a News based on the content of the NEWS file.
