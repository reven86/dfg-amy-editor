* Overview
World of Goo Level Editor (WooGLE) is a Gui tool for creating and editing levels for the puzzle game World of Goo.
The "original" version (written by Nitrozark.. up to v0.5) was mostly functional, but very clunky and difficult to use for inexperienced users, and experienced ones.

WooGLE aims to build on the good parts of original, and make it much easier to use.

* Major Improvements and New Features (beyond v0.5)
New Selection routines remove the need for separate Select Mode and Move Mode
New Toolbars for adding objects and adding Goos
Import Images directly from files held anywhere
Strand Mode : For adding strands between Goos
"One-Shot" Set Music and Set LoopSound buttons
All visual elements can be moved, resized and rotated graphically.
Handles TEXT resources for signs and labels
Allows direct creation of goomod files (used to distribute levels to other users)
Goos look like Goos
Undo and Redo functions
Many Many error checks added to warn / prevent WoG crashing when you run the level.

Full version information is held in Version text.

* As Binary
Often the simplest way to get WooGLE working on your system
Linux Binaries are available pre-compiled from the WooGLE Download page
http://goofans.com/download/utility/world-of-goo-level-editor


*Running from source
1) Check that you have installed PyQt
on Ubuntu - the package is python-qt4 : "sudo apt-get install python-qt4"
Available to download here : http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

2) Make the launch script executable
Go to the proprieties of "launch.sh"
Go to the "Permissions" tab and check "Allow executing file as program".

3) To Launch
Simply double-click on "launch.sh" to run WooGLE 


* Compiling the binaries
- you need to install all packages listed in 3RD_PARTY_linux
* Preparing pyinstaller-1.4 and source code
- Make sure you work on an ext2/ext3/ext4 hard drive
- extract the content of pyinstaller-1.4.tar.bz2 to a folder of your choice
- copy the content from the src folder of WooGLE to the folder with pyinstaller-1.4
- Configure pyinstaller and bootloaders as described in the manual in the doc directory of pyinstaller [VERY IMPORTANT !!!]

* Generating the executable WooGLE from the source:
cd /PATH/pyinstaller-1.4                    ## That is your working directory
python Makespec.py -F wogeditor.py   
sudo python Build.py /PATH/pyinstaller-1.4/wogeditor/wogeditor.spec
==> Binary appears in /PATH/pyinstaller-1.4/wogeditor/dist

* Completing binary folder
- To finish you need the files.xml.bin, you can find it in the src folder
- Copy the compiled binary from the dist folder and files.xml.bin to a folder of your choice.

* Running your binaries on another system
- To run your created files on another system, copy them on the system and open the binary folder in terminal there.
- Then type chmod +x filename
- now they're executable 


* Three command-line tools are also provided
wogfile: can pack/unpack a .bin from/to an .xml file.
