<level ballsrequired="string" letterboxed="boolean" visualdebug="boolean" autobounds="boolean" textcolor="rgb_color" texteffects="boolean" timebugprobability="real" strandgeom?="boolean" allowskip?="boolean" texteffects?="boolean" cursor1color?="rgb_color" cursor2color?="rgb_color" cursor3color?="rgb_color" cursor4color?="rgb_color">
  attributes:  
  - ballsrequired: an integer that represents the minimum number of balls to collect to complete
    the level, or an empty string if there is no such requirement (for example, in island maps)
  - letterboxed: "true" in level map, "false" in island map. Letter box display ~(16/9).
  - visualdebug: ?
  - autobounds: ? "true" to indicate that the player camera is bounded to a 'visited' area. That is the player need to move its construct to extend the bound. "false" indicates that the player can visit all the level with the camera.
  - textcolor: color of displayed text
  - timebugprobability: ? Probably of occurrences of a time bug (based on what? Move ?). 
                        Notes: There is also some level with value "false" or "".
  - strandgeom: ? I wonder if this indicates the presence of existing non deformable geometry (e.g. the grey cubes)
  - texteffects: ? Only a few level have it.  
  - cursor1color: ? Set to green in HelloWorld, GravePineVirus.  
  - cursor2color: ? Set to cyan in HelloWorld, GravePineVirus.  
  - cursor3color: ? Set to blue in HelloWorld, GravePineVirus.  
  - cursor4color: ? Set to red in HelloWorld, GravePineVirus.

  - scaley: ? widden factor? Usually in range [0.7,1.3]  
  - text: reference id for text painted on the sign-post.
  - particles: ? Reference to particule effect applied to sign-post. Not present for most level. An handful have the value "signpostAlertMom"
  
<pipe id="integer" depth="real" type?="">
